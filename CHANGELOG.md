# Changelog - YellowSphere

All notable user-facing and compatibility-relevant changes are documented here.
The v1.6.6 source of truth is `YellowSphere.html` plus the byte-level
references in `docs/`. The previous v1.6.4 standalone build is archived under
`lts/`.

The project originally used a rolling `YellowSphere` release tag, then
`-production` suffixes, and now uses plain semantic versions for promoted
releases. Older entries below preserve that history while normalizing the
format.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.6] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Promoted the beta standalone HTML to the canonical `YellowSphere.html`
  filename and archived the previous production build as
  `lts/YellowSphere_v1.6.4_LTS.html`.
- Added Playwright coverage for keyfile file-picker import, keyfile drag-and-drop
  import, encrypted keyfile import, wrong-password handling, and CSP hash
  enforcement. The interaction tests build temporary `.arc` and keyfile contents
  in memory, avoiding external fixtures or dependencies.
- Added drag-and-drop support to keyfile import rows. Dropped keyfiles use the
  same validation, password handling, status messages, and credential-mode
  behavior as keyfiles selected with the file picker.
- Made the keyfile drop area more apparent with a persistent dashed outline,
  drop icon, clearer helper text, and a drag-over highlight.

### Changed

- Promoted the browser build to `1.6.6`.
- Updated the Python package metadata for YellowSphere v1.6.6 and published the
  rebuilt wheel and source archive under `releases/python/`.
- Kept drag-and-drop limited to keyfile loading; encrypted seed imports continue
  to use the `Import Seed` file picker.
- Deferred browser object-URL revocation for 10 seconds after initiating a
  download, improving reliability in Safari, Firefox, and other browsers while
  leaving the Tauri native export path unchanged.
- Consolidated output-panel and QR-modal `Escape` handling into one global
  keydown dispatcher.
- `handleClearAll` now cancels and resets pending idle-warning state, dismisses
  any visible idle countdown banner, and prevents stale countdown warnings after
  manual clears, visibility-security clears, or idle-timeout clears.

### Added

- Added a reusable Playwright test harness for `YellowSphere.html` with a
  worker-scoped local HTTP server, application-page fixture, browser console and
  page-error enforcement, and shared independent Web Crypto reference helpers.
- Added browser conformance tests for YellowSphere ARC V3 Password, Keyfile, and Keyfile +
  Password modes; fixed padding and field sizes; authenticated metadata and
  ciphertext tampering; wrong credentials; encrypted-keyfile v2; and legacy
  YellowSphere ARC V2/encrypted-keyfile v1 compatibility.
- Added `test`, `test:crypto`, and `test:html` npm commands alongside the focused
  `test:smoke` command.
- Added an optional `PLAYWRIGHT_EXECUTABLE_PATH` override for environments that
  provide a system Chromium-family browser instead of Playwright-managed
  Chromium.
- Added a dependency-free Python `unittest` harness covering BIP39 vectors,
  mnemonic generation, BIP84 derivation, YellowSphere ARC V2 encryption/armor/tamper
  rejection, CLI JSON output, launcher versioning, and packaged GUI assets.
- Added a Windows Tauri release harness that validates synchronized release
  identity, prepared frontend assets, bundle icons, Rust unit tests, and,
  optionally, MSI/NSIS builds, artifact sizes, hashes, versioned filenames, and
  Authenticode signatures.
- Added `test:python`, `test:tauri`, `test:tauri:windows`, and `test:release` npm
  commands for focused and combined release validation.

- Added protected `.arc` format v3 to `YellowSphere.html`. V3 uses
  AES-256-GCM, a 32-byte random salt, a 12-byte nonce, a 128-bit tag, and a
  fixed 512-byte padded plaintext payload.
- Added AES-256-GCM encrypted keyfile version 2 with authenticated keyfile magic
  and format metadata. Existing encrypted keyfile version 1 import remains
  supported.
- Added an authenticated `credential_mode` field to YellowSphere ARC V3 bundles with
  `password`, `keyfile`, or `both` values.

- Added a Settings -> Advanced `Tab-Switch Grace Period` toggle. The default
  behavior now waits 15 seconds before clearing sensitive fields when the tab
  is hidden, and cancels the pending clear if the user returns in time. The
  setting can be disabled to restore immediate clearing and is persisted
  locally.
- Added a persistent Settings -> Advanced `Session Timeout` selector with
  2-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute, and Off options. Five minutes remains the
  default, and timeout changes take effect immediately.
- Added a restrictive Content Security Policy that denies network connections,
  permits only the exact hashed inline scripts, and blocks script attributes,
  objects, frames, workers, media, manifests, and form submissions.

### Changed

- Changed new v1.6.6 Password-mode YellowSphere ARC V3 key derivation to SHA-512 pre-hashing
  followed by PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 at 1,000,000 iterations.
- Changed new v1.6.6 Keyfile-mode YellowSphere ARC V3 derivation to HKDF-SHA512. Combined mode
  now mixes raw keyfile bytes and NFKD-normalized password bytes with
  HKDF-SHA512 using the YellowSphere ARC salt and the fixed info string
  `yellowsphere-arc-v3-combined-key`.
- Changed newly generated password-protected keyfiles to SHA-512 password
  pre-hashing, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 at 1,000,000 iterations, and AES-256-GCM with
  a 12-byte nonce. Existing 200,000-iteration version 2 keyfiles remain readable.
- YellowSphere ARC V3 authenticates all bundle metadata as AES-GCM additional authenticated
  data and no longer emits the YellowSphere ARC V2 separate MAC field.

- Debounced live root-fingerprint refreshes and serialized fingerprint and
  address-derivation work through latest-request-wins queues. Manual and
  automatic derivations can no longer overlap, queued stale work is collapsed,
  derivations take priority over fingerprint refreshes, and Clear All
  invalidates pending or in-flight results.
- Moved derivation-info icon event registration out of the seed-import path so
  its input and currency-change listeners are registered exactly once during
  UI initialization instead of accumulating after repeated imports.
- Embedded the favicon as a byte-identical base64 data URI so the standalone
  HTML no longer depends on a relative favicon path.
- Replaced the settings, QR export, and credential-dialog text close glyphs
  with a shared, consistently sized SVG close icon while retaining their
  accessible labels.
- Replaced heavyweight mnemonic validation with checksum-only validation where
  seed and master-key derivation are not required.
- Changed live root-fingerprint refreshes to use a fingerprint-only derivation
  path instead of creating immutable hex strings for the complete BIP39 seed
  and master private key on every refresh.

### Security

- Added best-effort zeroing of temporary password, keyfile, salt, padded
  plaintext, and decrypted-plaintext byte arrays in the new YellowSphere ARC V3 and
  encrypted-keyfile v2 paths.
- Preserved the legacy combined-secret construction exclusively for YellowSphere ARC V2
  decryption so existing Password, Keyfile, and Keyfile + Password backups
  remain recoverable.

- Added best-effort zeroing for temporary `Uint8Array` buffers containing
  mnemonic/passphrase encodings, BIP39 seed bytes, serialized private keys,
  chain codes, HMAC results, checksums, and derivation intermediates.
- Added cleanup of discarded BIP32, Ed25519/SLIP-0010, Cardano, Taproot, WIF,
  extended-private-key, and Stellar StrKey working buffers after use.
- JavaScript strings and `BigInt` values remain subject to JavaScript runtime
  garbage collection and cannot be reliably overwritten in place.

### Fixed

- Made YellowSphere ARC V3 credential mode explicit so Password-mode strings beginning with
  reserved keyfile prefixes cannot be misclassified or locked to the wrong
  import workflow.
- Cleared credential-dialog password, confirmation, file-input, and keyfile
  secret state on completion, cancellation, timeout, and visibility clearing.
- Made the password meter penalize exact repeated patterns and label its output
  as a rough character-diversity score rather than an entropy guarantee.
- Synchronized the Playwright fixture title expectation with v1.6.6.

- Fixed stale smoke-test assumptions for the document title and ambiguous
  Generate/Export button locators, and hardened local test-server teardown so
  HTTP keep-alive connections cannot stall the runner.
- Changed the Rust export unit-test fixture to write under the OS temporary
  directory instead of the user's Downloads folder, allowing restricted CI and
  sandboxed Windows release validation without changing production exports.

- Fixed the mojibake ellipsis in the Bitcoin Cash CashAddr example shown in
  Advanced Settings.

### Verified

- Verified YellowSphere ARC V3 Password, Keyfile, and Keyfile + Password modes against
  independent Web Crypto PBKDF2, HKDF, and AES-GCM derivations.
- Verified YellowSphere ARC V3 fixed-size padding, salt and nonce lengths, wrong-credential
  rejection, and rejection of modified metadata or ciphertext.
- Verified encrypted-keyfile v2 independently and confirmed encrypted-keyfile
  v1 plus YellowSphere ARC V2 Password, Keyfile, and combined-mode compatibility.

- Verified both inline scripts parse successfully and match the SHA-256 hashes
  authorized by the Content Security Policy.
- Verified the embedded favicon decodes to the exact original 3,976-byte PNG
  and that no external favicon path remains.
- Verified the promoted HTML introduces no new whitespace errors.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-06-17

  routing, exports, and QR URI handling.

### Compatibility Notes

- YellowSphere ARC V2 seed-backup encryption and import behavior are unchanged from v1.6.0.
- The Python GUI now embeds the v1.6.1 production browser application. The
  Python CLI derivation engine remains a separate compatibility surface.
- Promoted Tauri package, application, and Rust crate metadata to v1.6.1 and
  rebuilt the Windows x64 executable, MSI, and NSIS installer from the v1.6.1
  production browser application. macOS and Linux artifacts remain v1.6.0.

### Changed

- Replaced the coin datalist with a standard select control, alphabetized with
  Bitcoin pinned as the default.
- Derivation now selects the active network profile from the Testnet setting
  while preserving the selected currency in output metadata.
- Changing Bitcoin or Litecoin script type while Testnet is enabled updates
  the default path to the corresponding testnet purpose path.
- Generalized the Testnet setting across supported currencies.
- Cached QR modal elements in the shared element map and added reliable Escape
  handling for the modal fallback path.
- Added confirmation before `Generate Random Seed` replaces existing seed
  material.
- Added immediate clearing of seed, passphrase, and derived output when the
  browser tab loses visibility.
- Clipboard-copy failures in derived tables and extended-key views now surface
  a visible status message.
- Relocated inline jsPDF third-party attribution and license comments from
  `YellowSphere_Beta.html` into `docs/ThirdPartyNotices.txt` without changing
  executable HTML behavior.
- Cleaned garbled non-license comments in `YellowSphere_Beta.html` while leaving
  functional code unchanged.

### Verified

- Verified inline JavaScript parsing, standalone page initialization, seed
  generation, BIP39 validation, settings, output views, QR generation, and PDF
  export during the beta-to-production promotion.
- Verified mainnet/testnet derivation behavior for the currencies retained in
  the v1.6.1 production selector.
- Verified the promoted production build reports YellowSphere v1.6.1 and the
  archived v1.6.0 build reports YellowSphere v1.6.0 LTS.
- Verified the v1.6.1 Windows Tauri executable launches, embeds the v1.6.1
  prepared HTML asset, and produces versioned MSI and NSIS packages.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-14

### Release Identity

- Promoted the repaired beta line to the canonical `YellowSphere.html`
  v1.6.0 release.

### Changed

- Current protected `.arc` export uses armored `YELLOWSPHERE-ARC-V2` text with
  PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, 1,000,000 iterations, 32-byte salt, 24-byte nonce,
  HMAC-SHA512 stream encryption, and HMAC-SHA512 authentication.
- YellowSphere ARC V2 import rejects iteration counts below 600,000.
- The v1.6.0 docs distinguish the full canonical HTML feature set from the
  narrower Python CLI compatibility surface.
- Tauri asset preparation byte-copies the canonical HTML to preserve Unicode
  seed-mask text and inline assets.
- PDF export uses the inline jsPDF bundle rather than an eval-based or remote
  loader.
- Tauri export failures are surfaced as explicit UI errors.
- Release documentation now treats checked-in `releases/` files as local build
  artifacts that require per-release hash verification.
- v1.6.0 macOS release `.app` bundles are ad-hoc signed and DMGs are generated
  from the signed app bundles.

### Fixed

- XRP QR payload formatting now uses `?dt=` with a valid separator.
- Tagless XRP QR output now appends `?dt=00000` for scanner compatibility.
- XRP QR rendering uses a dedicated 320 px renderer and wider modal sizing.
- QR canvas CSS now scales on narrow viewports without overflow.
- QR capacity selection accounts for terminator bits and removes an incorrect
  version-10 short-circuit.
- Repaired damaged inline jsPDF and stripped JavaScript conditionals in the
  beta line so standalone HTML and rebuilt Tauri apps initialize correctly.

  Dogecoin, Ethereum / ERC-20, Solana, Stellar, Monero, Cardano, and XRP.
- The Python CLI remains a compatibility/scripted surface for Bitcoin,
  Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, and XRP.
- Current `.arc` exports are armored YellowSphere ARC V2. Legacy JSON V2, Python V1,
  browser AES-GCM V1, and older PBKDF2-SHA256/XOR-HMAC import paths remain
  supported where implemented.

## [1.5.2-beta] - 2026-06-13
